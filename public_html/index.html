    <h1>Theta Chi at Georgia Tech</h1>
        <p>Since its founding in 1856, Theta Chi Fraternity has grown to more than 219 chapters and colonies across North America and has initiated over 170,000 brothers. The Alpha Nu Chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity was founded at Georgia Tech in 1923. Since then, Theta Chi has been making men better in all areas of life, extending beyond the college years alone.</p>
        <p>Our 71 brothers strive to develop leadership through campus involvement and through the many different positions available within the house. Some of the many campus organizations that our brothers participate in are FASET Orientation, Connect With Tech, the Interfraternity Council, the Ramblinâ€™ Reck Club, GT Student Foundation, GT Tour Guides, and SGA. Brothers are also involved in religious organizations on campus and many are members of honor organizations.</p>

        <p>At Theta Chi, we believe in the Helping Hand and volunteer many hours to benefit the surrounding community as well as our very own Shirlock Foundation. We are great enthusiasts of athletics and sports by competing in Greek Week and Georgia Tech intramurals. In the last nine out of eleven years, we have been Greek Week Champions. Furthermore, some of our brothers are also involved in many of Georgia Tech's organizations including athletic clubs such as GT Rugby and GT Crew.</p>
        <p>Our house was built in 2003 and is able to comfortably house forty-four brothers. We are also one of only two houses on campus that enjoy a heated swimming pool. Throughout the year, Theta Chi hosts a large number of social events such as band parties, trips to away football games, summer lake trips, winter cabin weekends, as well as our spring Red Carnation formal. Amid all these different facets, Theta Chi is a place to grow and create a bond of brotherhood for life. We are ordinary men doing extraordinary things.</p>
