If you're maintaining this, here's some stuff you should know:
* The project uses server side includes, so you can't just host it off the filesystem.  The simplest way I found to test it was [here](https://github.com/danvk/ssi-server)
* The original code was written by John Verrone, and updated by Alex Hirschberg.  Contact: alexhirschberg97@gmail.com
* The instagram embed uses a javascript library called InstafeedJS, and I set up a developer account registered to my instagram (alexhirschberg)
